# Lab3_Task

Task 1
A survey company collects data on participants' favorite fruits. During the data collection
process, some records were partially transmitted due to intermittent connectivity issues,
resulting in missing values. Since these missing values are unrelated to participant
preferences and were introduced randomly, they need to be imputed using the datasetâ€™s
most representative values.

Hint: Plot The Dataset Using The Below Script To Visualize Some Interesting Behaviour
Of Data And Then Handle The Dataset Acoordingly.

Task 2
An e-commerce platform collects product ratings from customers. Some ratings are
missing due to incomplete surveys, and a few products have polarizing reviews (extremely
low or high ratings).

HINT: Handle The Mssing Values Per Category.
